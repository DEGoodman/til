# TIL
> Today I Learned

A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
repository after reading Simon Wilson's [hacker new post][1], and
Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2]. Additional credit goes to [cflynn07][3] for creating [this][4] helpful GitHub  action!
